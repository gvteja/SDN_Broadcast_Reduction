Reduction of Broadcast Traffic in Data Centers Using Software Defined Networking

Layer 2 switches provide a plug and play, administrator friendly flexible network which is well suited to the requirements of Data Centers. However, such networks generate a large amount of broadcast traffic resulting in scalability challenges. This paper addresses the requirements of a scalable and efficient Layer 2 network for Data Centers where the internal traffic performance is critical, through a Software Defined Networking  application. The global network topology information available at the SDN controller, is used to assign hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses to serve as host locators within the network. This structured addressing scheme enables the controller to insert high level forwarding policies in the switches, consequently avoiding switch broadcast traffic. Through the evaluation of our implementation we validate that our SDN application is successful in providing a significant performance boost in the internal communication for Layer 2 based Data Center networks as well as efficiently utilizing the in-built redundancy in the topology of such networks.
